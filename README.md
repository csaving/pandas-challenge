# PyCity Schools Analysis

The following analysis shows summaries of data at district level and school level. Highest and lowest perfoming schools are shown. Math and reading grades are broken down by school years. Scores are also analyzed by school spending, school size and school type. The following conclusions are found:

- If over 70% is considered passing, and only 65% of the school district's students are overall passing, then the school district is failing at producing passing students. 
- The top 5 performing schools are all charter schools, while all 5 bottom performing schools are district schools.
- On average, reading grades are higher than math grades.
- As spending per student increases, overall passing rate decreases.
